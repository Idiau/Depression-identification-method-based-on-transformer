"I enjoyed today, and I still am! Tomorrows depression can wait! : Today, I'm warm and cozy :) I even had some tea, to complement my sandwich!
This is a crazy time we live in, but it's only the beginning, with the world going to shambles, being alone feels werid.
But a stranger came through and saved me,
Of course it's a debt I'll have to repay, but I'm grateful to have this debt!
Crazy what a few dollars can do to change someones situation.
But these days, it's all about here and now!
I don't have the ability to relax just because, I'm full, clean, and warm.
Tomorrow it's back to reality! 
The motel was just to get ourself together! We been out here panicking the past two weeks and the last 3 days exspecially.
I got blessed this week that's for sure!
Two weeks till payday.
What to do, what to do.
Well I can't just pull another loan, so I gotta make what's left it last. 
Planet fitness anyone???!! 
Okay actually, gas wise, idk, finding safe places to park for extended periods of time, it's werid. You'd be surprised how much you stand out during everyone panicking staying at home at night.
Yet I also kinda like it. 
This motel would be $500 bucks for two weeks, maybe I can scrap the car for the room.
You know I remember back when I still had savings $500 was like not a big deal. Don't get me wrong $500 ain't nothing to sneeze at, but that was back in like June.
I'm seriously considering scraping the car, for that guarantee place to stay.
I can always save up 2-3 months and get another one...
Idk,
Today, I'm actually less sad.
But I guess this is the first time in like two weeks I could really analyze my situation, with rational thought.
Anyhow, tomorrow!!!!!!! We gotta get back on the hunt, maybe find some random gig, and I'd like to pay back that loan back early.
Easier to do work when you can eat!
March 27Th Please Hurry!"


"a story : I remember the time I'd get on my 3DS to play Nintendogs. I'd be at my grandparents house, having fun with my chihuahua. It was nice and calming, having no trouble when I need to get in a safe space. Peaceful music was played whenever I'd walk my dog. Competitive, yet smooth music played whenever I'd enter competitions. A fun experience was the least I could say. It was amazing.
I had a dog once. Well, not exactly my dog, it was my grandparents. We called him Bugsy (Bugzy?) and he was the best goddamn dog I knew. One day, my sisters and I were driving on a highway, when all of a sudden we heard a thud. We suddenly lost control of the vehicle, and we were forced to stop. When we collectively shit ourselves from what the hell just happened, my sister opened her door and went out to inspect what we hit.
It was Bugsy. A few weeks before, he ran away. I wasn't sure why he did, he was living a perfectly comfortable life. Perhaps he was seeking adventure? Nonetheless, we killed him. We ran him over because we didn't see him coming. We weren't expecting this to happen. We cried. We didn't know what to do with the body. She quietly put the carcass on the side of the road, as to not be ran over by others.
A while later, I got a 3DS and my first game: Nintendogs. And unfortunately, it reminded me of Bugsy. I wish I could have done more for that dog. I truly miss him. I would take care of him as much as I have taken care of that dog in the 3DS. I feel like an asshole when I say that, because it's ultimately true. I never played with Bugsy that often, but I still feel like I'm missing out when I think of him."
"The world only cares about beautiful people : I'm born ugly. I've always been ugly all my life and I don't think that I could ever become more beautiful. However, I used to think that if I tried my best and be a ""good"" person, people will like me too. But I'll never be treated like those who are beautiful. No matter how much I tried to become a excellent student, a helpful friend, others never really like me, no one cares about my existence. I have no real friends and I have never been in a relationship. In contrast, those beautiful people never have to try. They instantly become the center of attention, have a lot of friends and be successful in life. 
It's hard to accept that all my efforts would go in vain just because of my ugliness, something that is not even my fault. People usually say: "" Not only is he/she good looking but he/she is also nice"". Nah, you're wrong. They are nice because they are beautiful, they are nice because others treat them well and they don't have to suffer all the difficulties as us ugly do everyday."
"I try to be social. Guess what fucking happens. : No one wants to talk to me.
This is such fucking bullshit.  I make myself available, nobody wants to fucking talk with me or hang out with me.  Before any one of you comes at me with the ""you'll catch more flies with honey than with vinegar"", I've fucking tried that shit.  I've tried it for three goddamn decades and here's what it's gotten me:
-the complete and total lack of ability to create serotonin
-a shitty, abusive wife who said she would file the divorce papers in OCTOBER if ""I had no intention of reconciliation.""  Fuck you, dude, that's all I fucking DID was work to make YOU happy and sacrifice my own Goddamned mental wellbeing because I wanted to make YOU feel like you were worth something.  The least you could fucking do would be to file the goddamned paperwork.  Shouldn't be too fucking hard for you to do, since you decided to not even COME DOWN TO VISIT ME after our wedding.  So yeah.  Last day I fucking saw your ungrateful face was 5/20/17.
-The inability to feel anything other than complete and utter hatred 90% of the time
The only thing that's kept me happy is the meager social media interaction I have but even now that's starting to dwindle because people keep moving on.
People spend all of five minutes with me and ""oh, I'm too busy"" etc.
FUCK THAT YOU CAN TAKE TEN MINUTES OUT OF YOUR DAY AND HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH ME INSTEAD OF IGNORING ME.
I wish I had been born prettier.
Maybe then people would love me."
"I don't deserve love or affection. : I honestly am starting to believe I am going to die alone. I have never been good at establishing meaningful relationships with anyone, including my family. I have always felt like an outsider in every situation I've been in. I can't even make friends that ever become much more than acquaintances I see from time to time. Not once have I had what I could consider a best friend and dating has never been much better.
I have only dated three women, whom I was with long enough for us to meet each other's family. The longest of which was almost ten years and it ended in divorce. I have never been one to feel comfortable in my own skin and going out in public fills me with anxiety. I never participated in any sort of hook-up culture and it's been a little over two years since I had any sort of intimate contact with another person. I am miserably lonely and feel like there is just not a single person out there for me.
I've seen similar posts from people talking about the lack of intimacy in their own lives and how it takes a toll. I feel dead inside and really do not believe I am in any way adequate enough to make another person happy. With all the other stress in my life due to a complete lack of direction, little to no motivation, and an overall sense of existential dread, I doubt I am even in any condition to maintain a romantic relationship. I am miserable and that will only destroy anything I attempt to build.
I can't even remember what it is like to truly have feelings for someone, to be excited about the prospect of spending time with them, the joy of having someone in my life. I don't feel like it will ever happen again and if it does, I will probably just ruin it. At this point, things like getting married again, having kids, starting a family, buying a house, etc. none of those things appeal to me. I have absolutely no interest in them. I see no future for myself where I actually have a sense of self-worth or even the faintest sense of identity.
I just work and that is it. I try to get involved with a few things or groups, but nothing really makes me happy. I haven't got anything to look forward to when I wake up in the morning. Even getting a cat leaves me feeling empty. I see the weekend approaching and I know I will end up spending my evenings home alone with no one to talk to. It has always been like this, before and after my failed marriage.
In spite of the things my ex-wife did wrong, I feel more and more that I was the one to blame and that I simply do not deserve anything good in my life. I can't find it when I go looking for it and it doesn't seem to fall into place on its own. It's now less a question of IF and more a matter of WHEN. I am so tired of all this constant sameness. I just want it over."
"What am i? : I'm super depressed i guess, i don't want to go out, I don't want to talk to anyone, everything stresses me, I've done things i regret ever knowing or doing. Like I don't want this knowledge. I dont want to know anything. I want a easy life, and i dont have one, sometimes i feel like im in autopilot, when i feel lifeless, like when i dont feel anything, when i feel numb and so over with life, i dont want this life, is so complicated, so full o assholes and dark shit i dont want to be part of, i feel so tired. I guess one of the ways i cope is being isolated, but is not, it just makes this dark entity, it feeds through my isolation, my loneliness, my weaknesses, my stress, and when its full it explodes and it overpowers me. Im weak i feel useless, i dont have any aspiration, all my aspirations and goals are fake, they are not real thats not me. I dont have a me, i dont feel like i exist, i feel like this is not me, i dont know who is me i just know that when im not doing something everyone expects from me im not me, i just dont know who am i. The only thing i guess im sure of is that i have hope, just hope and want to live life, experience things, i want to know the secrets of the world, i want to know the unknown. I know i dont belong nowhere, like i have parents and siblings and a friend nut i dont feel a connection like i dont feel love, am i going crazy? i feel things but i dont know what they are i dont know sometimes. Like i care for them if they were ever in any kind of danger or pain and would give my life for my loved ones but in a regular day i feel like doing nothing like i fell nothing, im always distracting myself and doing stuff im good at i guess. I know im driving my loved ones away from myself but i know is best, they are better knowing im just an emo heartless bitch who doesn't care about anything, thats a selfish and has no future they are better of knowing all those things than my true self which is nothing im just no one with a job to carry on the life of this physical body. I dont know whats happening, i used to be different i used to be the opposite of what i am now, well i guess i was still a bitch but with more positive qualities than the bad ones im portraying right now.
ps: Im not gonna kill myself, and im here bc i dont have the resource to seek professional help."





"I did mushrooms a week ago : I did shrooms for the first time two weeks ago and it was the scariest experience of my life. I was so scared of my thoughts and felt stuck in my head. After that experience I felt completely sad and empty. A week later I decided to do it again but under different circumstances (people I was completely comfortable with, didn’t have to go home, etc) and it was the same thing. It made me realize how depressed I was and now I cant get out of my depression. I just feel like I’m just watching everyone live and I’m just stuck in my head. I dont wanna live like this forever and I don’t know what to do"
Need anyone to talk to : I just want to say. If anyone needs anyone to talk to I am hear for you. I'm not a professional or anything but I will be there to listen to you and try and help you .

"I will kill myself : I joined this subbreddit because for the first time of my life i found people with similar families to me. I am the usual i guess, divorced parents that still hate each other after years of their break-up, but this just goes beyond everything i would have ever imagined. I used to live with my mother and it was hell, no better word to describe it. She used to insult me just for being, calling me a usseles son and an autistic no-one, constantly trying to make fun of me and shame me for everything she could, this went on for a couple years, around 2 or so, until finally some months back i snapped, i just couldn't take it anymore. She started yelling at me for some stupid reason and i just tried to ignore her, but she entered my room and started just trowhing everything she could. My lap-top, my ps4, my phone, everything she could grab and throw into the wall was thrown. I just wasnt dealing with it anymore, the sadness just was pure madness at that point, i grabbed her and pushed her out of my room while she screamed at me full pshyco. I closed the door and hold it close while she tried to smash it down to get back in my room. She started crying and shouting to me things that i cant quite remember, at this point i was just pushing the door shut while crying. The moment was over-whelming, i tried my best to stay as stable as possible but i just felt so much anger and fear at the time. An hour later or so, my father showed up at my house and make me grab my stuff and leave. On the way to his apartment, he only stayed silent while looking at me, and i just tried my best to calm myself. When we arrived, he talked to me, he ask why did i did that and if i was okey with what i did. Soon i understood what he meant,my mother had called him telling him that i had hitt her and that i was just violent against women. My father never talked to me again about that, but afther that day things started to go down-fall.
I started going to the psychologist after that, my mother signed me up and made my father take me every week for about a month. There the stupid bitch talked to me about things like ""you should feel angry with women"" or ""hitting women is not okay"". I hated going, i hated going every week to be treated like a criminal, like if i was the one that needed help. After that i started living with my father, since my mother kicked my out of my house i had no where else to go. My room now is a little bed next to where he works. (He is a lawyer).
A month or so starting to get used to living with him i was just broken. I went from hanging out with friends every day and every night to stay away from home as much as possible to stay inside every-day whit my ps4, eating and doing as much as i could to avoid my friends, since they had no idea nor i have ever told them why i just stopped hanging out with them.
Since then my life has been a total disaster i dont want to try to fix anymore. I tried my best to go back to the person that i used to be, but every day its more and more difficult. I was just a normal kid, a 16 year old that would play ps4 and hang around with friends during the week and go partying some saturdays. Now im just a sad fucker, i still hang around with friends but i just dont feel the same anymore, i used to be the one that made everyone laughed and now im just the one that stays behind silent and laughs a little every now and then. My friends have noticed this but every time someone asks me ""is everything okay?"" Or ""are u fine?"" I just do my best to keep them away, what am i suppoused to say? That my mother is a psycho that kicked me out and my father beats me everythime he gets mad at me? I feel so ashamed, i feel so sad and angry, and i have to put all of that behind a mask of ""na bro, im fine, just sleepy"" and pretend im alright.
Like i said, my father gets angry at me for almost no reason, he hates that i play ps4, he hates that i go partying even tough he knows that i have always been really mature with the alchochol and that i have never ever had problems with it. There are nights where he just arrives from the job and sitts next to me, just to give me a large speech of how pathetic i am and how i will always be alone for the kind of person that i am, how no one will ever love me and how i will be left alone once he kicks me out of the house. I just do my best to cry as silently as possible, pretending that i dont care.
All this happened in the summer, so when i had to come back school (i am from Argentina) i had to face my mother again. At my school, wich is the only thing i really care, you have to sitt for an exam to enter another year. This exam is really easy and i have always been a good student so it hasnt ever meant a real deal to me, but this year was different. My mother called my father and told him that if i didnt passed this exam she would make sure that i got kicked out of school, so my father made me stay home for two hole weeks ""studying"" while my mother called him every few hours to ""check on me"". I passed this exam with a 10 (A+ i guess) but those weeks were a nightmare, my father was all day yelling at me to keep studying and to focus or i would go to another shitty school. Those nights were when all the reason why i write this began, the suicidal thoughts
Every night since those nights i cant avoid but think about how tired i am, how much i want to die and i really mean it. Every day i arrive home knowing that mu father will look at me into my eyes and give me that disaproving stare he always gives me. Every night i feel the door opening i drop my phone and pretend to be asleep so he doesnt talks to me. His words are knives into my very soul, i cant have peace anymore. Every time i look myself into the mirror i see everything that my father described, everytime i have time to think i just hear his words repeating themselves again and again, remembering me what i am and how little i deserve from others
I had dreams of being a doctor, i dreamed of finishing the book i was writing and i dreamed of getting to know someone else. Watching my ex next holding hands with another dude was like a bullet on a dead-body. It hurt, it really did, but at the time i was so fucked up that it meant nothing to me. Of course she gets to know someone new, she arrives home with a lovely mother and a care father that both treat her with respect and love. If i didnt had parents that hatted me i would be even better than her, but i am not, i am just a sad fuck that ""can't get over it"" and she gets to laugh with her friends about me every time she sees me.
Last-night was when i snapped again. My father came to me while i was having dinner alone and he told me that he doesnt want me to be with him anymore. He says that i dont help around the house and that i am just wasting his money and his time. He told me that he is going to send me back with my mother and that i dont get to decide if i wnat it or not.
I dont want to go, but i dont want to stay neither. My father does and did horribles things to me, but my mother is just hell to me, i cant deal with it anymore, i wont
I want to kill myself, i want to get up right now from the bed and sneek trough his bedroom, i want to go to the roof and jump. Im crying and i cant sleep because i know that deep down i really want to do it. I want help, i just want to hear someone, i dont want to do it even tought it seems the only thing to do. Please, i dont want to go to a psychologist and be treated like a criminal again. I know that my father wont care if i tell him how i feel, he will just get even more angry at me. I cant go back to my mother, i start shaking just of thinking of it. I need help, i need a way out of this no matter what."
